# Arduino-Smart-Window-Curtain
to let you feel safer when leaving your home, I introduce to you this Smart Window, the design is very simple and effective. Once you have installed smart windows in your home, night time and bad wether will no longer be a concern, you can modify all of the settings based on wether conditions or sun set and sun rise hours. Below is a default configuration:
  
```
If the sky is clear (sunrise, morning-afternoon):
	If it is not raining:
    	- Open the window
    	- Roll up the curtain
    If it is raining:
    	- Close the window
    	= Curtain remain unchanged
If the sky is dark (sunset, night time):
	- Close the window
	- Roll down curtain
```
